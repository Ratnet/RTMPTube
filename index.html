<p>RTMPTube is a tool to create live stream events on YouTube by managing the RTMP stream that YouTube requires, using FFMPEG as a streaming backend.</p>

<p>The current implementation uses <code>dvgrab</code> as a method of capturing video from hardware inputs, but this can readily be changed.</p>

<p>Installation is trivial - a build of FFMPEG is included, but if you have your own build, or want to use a repo build, the path to the FFMPEG build can easily be changed in the <code>STREAM.py</code> file. However, you must ensure that it is compiled with support for libx264, as YouTube expects FLV-wrapped h264 video. If in doubt, use the provided build.</p>

<h3>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p>Open <code>STREAM.py</code> file to begin the stream configuration wizard. All of the required values must match the ones on the YouTube Live Event Management page, on the Encoder tab.</p>

<p>You should only need to provide the Stream Name and the required resolution in order to start the stream - the stream URL should be acceptable at the default value.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At this time, there is no system to automatically provide the backup stream that YouTube has support for. However, if you wish to provide a backup stream, it should be possible to run a second instance of and alter the stream URL from the default value to the backup URL. <strong><a href="https://github.com/calmcl1/RTMPTube/issues/4">#4</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p>There is currently no support for the creation of new live events purely through the Google APIs, but this is planned. <strong><a href="https://github.com/calmcl1/RTMPTube/issues/3">#3</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p>There is currently no support for automatically detecting the resolution of a stream through the Google APIs when a stream name has been provided, but this is planned. <strong><a href="https://github.com/calmcl1/RTMPTube/issues/2">#2</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p>There is currently no support for toggling the PAL colour expansion, which is enabled by default, but this is planned. <strong><a href="https://github.com/calmcl1/RTMPTube/issues/1">#1</a></strong></p></li>
